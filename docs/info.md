### Clock Divider

![clock_divider](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85d75cce-3411-4b20-87f7-3f82fa0a16e9)

It receives a byte at its input (scale {ui_in[7:0]}), calculates true_scale = scale*CONST (CONST = 392160) and the clock frequency at the input is divided (clk_out {uo_out[0]} = clk_in {clk} / true_scale). If the scale is set to 0, the clk_in is just repeated at the clk_out. With scale = 1111_1111, it is possible to achieve true_scale ≈ 100e6. 


## How to test

### Temperature Sensor

- PTAT + Buffer: Measure the voltage coming out of `vts_in_buff` and its copy `out_buff` (`ib ≈ 20 uA`) at some temperature values to calibrate the sensor and find its linear equation.
- Σ∆: change the `in_sigma` voltage and see the changing in the patterns of the pulses in `out_sigma`. 

### Clock Divider

- Scale = choose a byte
- Connect clk_in to a clock signal
- Do the nrst to reset
- Observe the clock signal with the frequency divided into clk_out

## External hardware

### Temperature Sensor

- PTAT + Buffer: A chamber or simillar stuff to control the temperature, oscilloscope and sources.
- Σ∆: Oscilloscope and sources.

### Clock Divider

Signal generator to generate `clk_in` and a oscilloscope to see the `clk_out`. And switches or some microcontroler to set `scale[7:0]`.
