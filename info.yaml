# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "Temperature Sensor and Clock Divider"      # Project title
  author:       "Hugo Dias Gilo"      # Your name
  discord:      "hugodg"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Temperature sensor with PTAT, a buffer and a sigma-delta modulator and a clock divider to divide the clock frequency"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Analog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Valid values for analog projects: 1x2, 2x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 4        # Valid values: 0 to 6
  uses_3v3: false       # Set to true if your project uses 3.3V (VAPWR) in addition to 1.8V (VDPWR)

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
